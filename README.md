# RabbitMQ Prometheus.io exporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/deadtrickster/rabbitmq_prometheus.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/deadtrickster/rabbitmq_prometheus/tags)

## STOP! This is abandonware!

[Modern RabbitMQ release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/versions) ship with a [built-in Prometheus plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus) and a set
of Grafana dashboards.

This plugin is obsolete and really should not be used. It will not be compatible with the latest versions of RabbitMQ,
you will not get any support for the RabbitMQ Core team, and there are no reasons to choose this plugin
over the built-in one.

## What does this plugin do?

Implemented as RabbitMQ Management Plugin plugin.
Also exports Erlang VM and process metrics (~ 100 metrics in total).

Implemented using [Erlang Prometheus.io client](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus.erl)

## Versioning

While RabbitMQ transitions from webmachine to cowboy we maintain two branches one for 3.6.x and one for 3.7.x.
Plugin version should be read as follows: 3.7.1.x - where 3.7.1 is required RabbitMQ version and x is just incremental version of the plugin.

## Installation

 - [Release for latest RabbitMQ 3.7.x](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/releases/tag/v3.7.2.3)
 - [Release for latest RabbitMQ 3.6.x](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/releases/tag/rabbitmq-3.6.14.1);
 - [Release for RabbitMQ 3.6.8 and 3.6.9](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/releases/tag/rabbitmq-3.6.9.1);
 - [Release for RabbitMQ 3.6.5](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/releases/tag/rabbitmq-3.6.5.9).

Download suitable version and follow regular [RabbitMQ plugin installation instructions](http://www.rabbitmq.com/installing-plugins.html).

```
 rabbitmq-plugins enable prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter
```

If you are running on Linux/FreeBSD/Mac, you may find `prometheus_process_exporter` useful:

```
rabbitmq-plugins enable prometheus_process_collector
```

[Prometheus process collector](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_process_collector).

### Troubleshooting

#### `undef` error

If you see something like this:

```
{could_not_start,rabbitmq_management,
       {undef,
           [{prometheus_http,setup,[],[]}
```

I.e. `undef` error mentioning a module starting with `prometheus_`, chances you forgot to enable a plugin (see https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/issues/27 for example).

#### Module `prometheus_process_collector` is unloadable

```
{plugin_module_unloadable,"prometheus_process_collector",
                             {error,on_load_failure}}
```

or

```
{error,{load_failed,"Failed to load NIF library:
 '/<...>/plugins/prometheus_process_collector-1.1.0/priv/prometheus_process_collector.so:
 failed to map segment from shared object'"}}
```

Prometheus process collector uses NIFs underneath and failed to load shared object in module on_load callback.
Please check that `RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_EXPAND_DIR` doesn't have `noexec` flag set (see https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/issues/26).

#### Crashes with something like {error,{bad_lib,"Library version (2.11) not compatible (with 2.10)."}}

This means [erl_nif](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html) version `prometheus_process_collector` built with differs from yours (see Version Management section).
You can rebuild the plugin yourself very easily - `clone https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_process_collector.git` and run `rebar3 archive`

#### Glibc-related errors when `prometheus_process_collector` enabled

`prometheus_process_collector` plugin comes with prebuilt shared object. And it looks like my Glibc version differs from yours.
You can rebuild the plugin yourself very easily - `clone https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_process_collector.git` and run `rebar3 archive`

### Latest Docker:
 `docker run -p 8080:15672 deadtrickster/rabbitmq_prometheus`

Alpine-based image is also available:
 `docker run -p 8080:15672 deadtrickster/rabbitmq_prometheus:latest-alpine`

## Configuration

This exporter supports the following options via `rabbitmq_exporter` entry of `prometheus` app env:
 - `path` - scrape endpoint. Default is `"metrics"`. Note RabbitMQ translates this to `"{management_plugin_path_prefix}/api/metrics"`;
 - `use_mgmt_auth` - use built-in management auth. Default is `false`. If true, relies on management plugin for authentication (that guest:guest on fresh setups);
 - `format` - scrape format. Default is `prometheus_text_format`;
 - `exchange_messages_stat` - same as `queue_messages_state` but for the exchanges;
 - `queue_messages_stat` - messages state to export. Default is hopefully reasonable. You can read more about possible values [here](https://raw.githack.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/rabbitmq_v3_6_5/priv/www/doc/stats.html);
 - `connections_total_enabled` - Default is `false`. If `true`, the exporter will iterate over all connections and export count grouped by connection state (running, flow, etc).

Sample `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config` showing how to customize the scrape `path`, and `connections_total_enabled`:

```erlang
[
 {rabbit, [
   {loopback_users, []},
   {tcp_listeners, [5672]},
   {ssl_listeners, []}
 ]},
 {prometheus, [
   {rabbitmq_exporter, [
     {path, "/mymetrics"},
     {connections_total_enabled, true}
   ]}
 ]},
 {rabbitmq_management, [
   {listener, [
     {port, 15672},
     {ssl, false}
   ]}
 ]}
].
```

For the latest list of supported options look [here](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter/blob/master/src/prometheus_rabbitmq_exporter_config.erl).
